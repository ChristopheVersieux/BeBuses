# BeBuses
Belgian Buses for Android

This is another transport application for Belgium.
This applications follows the Google design guidelines and provides (IMHO) a better design to what currently exists (Not naming the famous closed source one and nothing open sourced)

Currently working with GTFS files, while waiting for a dedicated API.
Navitia provides a first try to achieve an app: https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/be/coords/4.068009;50.573507/lines
But not good enough yet!
