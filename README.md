Belgian Buses for Android

This is another transport application for Belgium, bringing the new visual language from Google (Material Design).

Current objectives are:
- Faster
- Nicer
- Easier

Currently working with GTFS files, while waiting for a dedicated API.
Navitia provides a first try to achieve an app: https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/be/coords/4.068009;50.573507/lines
But not good enough yet!
